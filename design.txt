- mechanics: move captain alot around the screen and press dig button to try to find 4 items. selected number of support alots (up to 3) wander toward an item and then bounce around in its leash radius based on their focus
    - alot makes a sound to indicate how close it is to the item (range refers to item dig radius)
        - "mrrr" = not in range
        - "mrrR?" = barely in range 
        - "mrrRR!" = well within range
        - "mrrRRuh!" = quite close
        - "mrrRROOH!" = just barely missing it
        - "MRRRROOH!!" = yay found it

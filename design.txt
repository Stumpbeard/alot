Breeding & Management overview
- player satisfaction: collect more colors of alots
- premise: breed 2 alots together to try to make a baby alot or give bonus stats
- scene: side-menu next to view of all your alots in a cute lil pasture
- mechanics: 
    - mouse over alots to see stats and status. click on an alot for more options.
        - more options: feed, breed, or have an adventure (racing & digging)
    - alot status:
        - updates after every adventure
        - status list:
            - horny: This alot wants to breed. They will do poorly in a race because they're preoccupied. Breeding now will give a boost for the next adventure. (clears after breeding)
            - competitive: This alot wants to race. +1 to Spunk. (see stats, clears after racing)
            - observant: This alot is focused and perceptive. +1 item in next dig. (clears after digging)
            - tired: This alot doesn't want to do anything. Unable to breed, race, or dig for now. (clears after any other alot has an adventure)
        - all statuses have 50% chance to disappear and a 20% chance to appear after any alot does any activity.
            - up to two statuses at once
            - roll statuses in random order, stop rolling after all have been rolled or two statuses have been applied.
    - alot stats:
        - speed
            - racing: adds to total racing score
            - digging: higher = move faster on screen (captain and support)
        - endurance
            - racing: adds to total racing score
            - digging: 
                - alot captain: higher = lower cooldown between digs
                - alot of support: higher = less severe movespeed degradation over time
        - focus
            - racing: adds to total racing score
            - digging: 
                - alot captain: digging * 2% chance for an extra diggable item to spawn
                - alot of support: tighter item leash radius
        - spunk
            - racing: spunk * 10% chance to add 20% bonus to total racing score
            - digging: spunk * 5% chance to add 30sec bonus to timer (captain, no effect for support)
    - breeding:
        - always removes horny status
        - babies only result from male + female alots when the female is horny
        - gay alot breeding gives stat boost for racing or digging
            - 50-50 chance to get competitive or curious status
            - if participating alot is horny: roll normal 50-50 chance and then roll again with 50% chance to get the bonus not already gotten
    - feeding:
        - can feed an alot up to two things per time cycle

Breeding Mechanics:
- Alots have genes for each possible color (regular, red, blue, green, yellow, purple, pink)
- Strength of genes is represented by numbers that add up to 100 across all genes
- Each alot has a dominant color with a gene value of 25. This is what color they are in-game.
- the other colors are determined by their parents for bred alots
- for progenitor alots:
    - dominant color is at 25, remaining 6 colors are randomly rolled to be numbers between 1 and 20 inclusive--all 6 numbers added together should add up to 75
    - ex progenitor alot color stats: brown 25; red 10; blue 10; green 15; yellow 12; purple 16, pink 12
- for baby alots:
    - add together parents' stats by color and average. Top value becomes dominant, value snaps to 25. If top value was less than 25, it takes the needed stats from the lowest color. If above, it gives the extra to the lowest.
    - example: 
               Alot Parent 1 (brown)   Alot Parent 2 (red)     Average              Baby (purple)
    brown           25***                   5                   15                  15 
    red             10                      25***               17.5                17.5
    blue            10                      20                  15                  15
    green           15                      6                   10.5                3.5
    yellow          12                      14                  13                  13
    purple          16                      20                  18***               25***
    pink            12                      10                  11                  11


Digging overview:
- player satisfaction: hopefully just fun on its own + prizes are food to affect alot status
- premise: take your alot out to the forest or whatever to dig for stuff
- scene: one player-controlled alot in a grassy area
- mechanics: move captain alot around the screen and press dig button to try to find 4 items. selected number of support alots (up to 3) wander toward an item and then bounce around in its leash radius based on their focus
    - alot makes a sound to indicate how close it is to the item (range refers to item dig radius)
        - "mrrr" = not in range
        - "mrrR?" = barely in range 
        - "mrrRR!" = well within range
        - "mrrRRuh!" = quite close
        - "mrrRROOH!" = just barely missing it
        - "MRRRROOH!!" = yay found it 




Racing overview
- player satisfaction: winning feels nice + prizes are love potions that increase chances of specific color of alot baby 
    - ex: pink love potion = better chance to get pink alot from breeding
- premise: enter an alot into a (non-controlled) race that resolves based on stats + rng. win prizes.
- scene: 
- mechanics: 





Items:
- pineapple: spunk + 2 until next turn
- eggplant: makes alot horny 
- carrot: focus + 2 until next turn
- apple: endurance + 2 until next turn
